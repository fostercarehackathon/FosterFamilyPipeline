The frontend is going to be done using [React][1], [Redux][2] and [Webpack][3].
Use Node 5, please.

## Quick Start

Check `npm run-script` to see what's available. Some commands:

  * `npm run serve`: Runs the site in **development** mode.
  * `npm run test:watch`: Runs the tests and listens for them.

Don't run the tests. It's a [*hackathon*][4], fam.
